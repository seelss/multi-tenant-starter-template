We are building a enterprise ready phone diagnostic automation tool.  Things like this take a while to build, so I am slowly adding stuff over time.  It is very importnant to remember the following:
- Never add unnecessary files or code
- Make sure everything is modular and sectional
- Always use best coding practices
- If there is any uncertainity, ask for clarification.  Design things with the knowledge that more features will be added later.




I also already have a venv in the local_backend/venv folder
